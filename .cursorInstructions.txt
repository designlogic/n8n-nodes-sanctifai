Custom n8n Node Requirements Document - SanctifAI
Project Overview
	•	Node Name: SanctifAI (n8n-nodes-sanctifai)
	•	Description: This node sends a message and a workflow ID to a hardcoded endpoint. It also retrieves a list of available workflows from a specified endpoint.
	•	Version: 1.0.0
Dependencies
	•	Base Template: n8n Nodes Starter (https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter)
	•	Node.js Version: >=14
Functional Requirements
1. Core Functionality
	•	The node will send HTTP POST requests to the hardcoded endpoint:



	•	The payload must include:
	•	Message: A JSON string containing the message to be sent.
	•	Workflow ID: A string representing the ID of the related workflow.
2. Data Retrieval
	•	The node will fetch available workflows from the endpoint:



	•	The response will include a collection of workflows containing:
	•	Key: The unique ID of the workflow.
	•	Name: The human-readable name of the workflow.
3. Authentication
	•	The node will not include authentication, as the endpoints are publicly accessible.
4. Operations
	•	POST Operation:
	•	Input Parameters:
	▪	Message (required, type: string)
	▪	Workflow ID (required, type: string)
	•	Output Structure:
	▪	Confirmation of successful post with response data from the endpoint, structured as:
{
    "success": true,
    "message": "Request submitted",
    "requestId": "d51bdd40-6064-4eee-99c5-882d5dddcaad"
}

	•	Error Handling: None specified at this stage.
5. Configuration Options
	•	Node Properties:
	•	Message: (string, required) Text to be sent to the endpoint.
	•	Workflow ID: (string, required) The ID of the workflow.
	•	Workflows List: (read-only) Dropdown populated with workflow names fetched from the second endpoint.
User Interface
	•	Design Preferences: Standard design will be used for the user interface with appropriate labels for inputs and tooltips where necessary.
Testing
	•	Concerns: No specific edge cases or scenarios to focus on during testing.
Documentation
	•	Format/Structure: Standard documentation format will be used, possibly including examples as needed.
Deployment
